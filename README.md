About Image_AutoTrainer 
Image_AutoTrainer is an object classification library which is build on top of the machine learning libraris such as tensorflow and keras. This library allows you to experiment faster with image classification problems on different art of state models in deep learning. you can classify any image with any model without writing n lines of code. 

Some advantages Image_AutoTrainer :

Simple -- it is simple in implementation, it save a lot of time of a developer, 

Flexible -- Keras adopts the principle of progressive disclosure of complexity: simple workflows should be quick and easy thatâ€™s why 
Image_AutoTrainer is Flexible.

Powerful -- Keras provides industry-strength performance and scalability: so we can use Image_AutoTrainer in the production
