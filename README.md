About Image_AutoTrainer 
Image_AutoTrainer is an object classification library that is built on top of machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras. This library allows you to experiment faster with image classification problems on different art of state models in deep learning. you can classify any image with any model without writing n lines of code. 

Some advantages Image_AutoTrainer :

Simple -- it is simple in implementation, it saves a lot of time for a developer, 

Flexible -- Keras adopts the principle of progressive disclosure of complexity: simple workflows should be quick and easy thatâ€™s why 
Image_AutoTrainer is Flexible.

Powerful -- Keras offers robust performance and scalability, enabling the utilization of Image_AutoTrainer in a production environment.
